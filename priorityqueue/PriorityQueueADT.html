    <p>A priority queue is a queue in which each item is assigned a priority and items with
a higher priority are removed before those with a lower priority, irrespective of when
they were added. <u>Integer values are used for the priorities with a smaller integer
value having a higher priority.</u> A bounded priority queue restricts the priorities to
the integer values between zero and a predefined upper limit whereas an unbounded
priority queue places no limits on the range of priorities.</p>
    <ul>
        <li> <i>PriorityQueue </i>(): Creates a new empty unbounded priority queue. </li>
        <li> <i> BPriorityQueue</i> ( numLevels ): Creates a new empty bounded priority queue
with priority levels in the range from 0 to numLevels - 1. </li>
        <li> <i>isEmpty </i> (): Returns a boolean value indicating whether the queue is empty.</li>
        <li> <i>length </i>(): Returns the number of items currently in the queue. </li>
        <li> <i>enqueue </i>( item, priority ): Adds the given item to the queue by inserting it
in the proper position based on the given priority. The priority value must
be within the legal range when using a bounded priority queue. </li>
        <li> <i>dequeue </i>(): Removes and returns the front item from the queue, which is the
item with the highest priority. The associated priority value is discarded. If
two items have the same priority, then those items are removed in a FIFO
order. An item cannot be dequeued from an empty queue. </li>

    </ul>
