<p>
An expression tree is a binary tree representation of an arithmetic expression that
consists of various operators (+, -, *, /, %) and operands comprised of single
integer digits and single-letter variables within a fully parenthesized expression.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>ExpressionTree</i>( exp_str ): Builds an expression tree for the expression given
in expStr. Assume the string contains a valid, fully parenthesized expression.</li>

    <li><i>evaluate </i>(var_dict): Evaluates the expression tree and returns the numeric
result. The values of the single-letter variables are extracted from the supplied
dictionary structure. An exception is raised if there is a division by zero error
or an undened variable is used.</li>
    <li><i>toString</i>(): Constructs and returns a string representation of the expression.</li>

</ul>
