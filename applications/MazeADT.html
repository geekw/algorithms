<p>
    A maze is a two-dimensional structure divided into rows and columns of equal-sized
cells. The individual cells can be filled representing a wall or empty representing
an open space. One cell is marked as the starting position and another as the exit.
</p>

<ul>
    <li> <i>Maze </i>( numRows, numCols ): Creates a new maze with all of the cells initialized
as open cells. The starting and exit positions are undened. </li>
    <li> <i>numRows </i>(): Returns the number of rows in the maze. </li>
    <li> <i>numCols </i>(): Returns the number of columns in the maze. </li>
    <li> <i>setWall </i>( row, col ): Fills the indicated cell (row, col) with a wall. The cell
indices must be within the valid range of rows and columns. </li>
    <li> <i>setStart </i>( row, col ): Sets the indicated cell (row, col) as the starting posi-
tion. The cell indices must be within the valid range. </li>
    <li> <i>setExit </i>( row, col ): Sets the indicated cell (row, col) as the exit position.
The cell indices must be within the valid range. </li>
    <li> <i>findPath </i>(): Attempts to the solve the maze by nding a path from the starting
position to the exit. If a solution is found, the path is marked with tokens (x)
and True is returned. For a maze with no solution, False is returned and the
maze is left in its original state. The maze must contain both the starting and
exit position. Cells on the perimeter of the maze can be open and it can be
assumed there is an invisible wall surrounding the entire maze. </li>
    <li> <i>reset </i>(): Resets the maze to its original state by removing any tokens placed
during the nd path operation. </li>
    <li> <i>draw </i>(): Prints the maze in a readable format using characters to represent the
walls and path through the maze, if a path has been found. Both the starting
and exit positions are also indicated, if previously set. </li>
</ul>
