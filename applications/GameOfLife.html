<h3>Introduction to the Game of Life</h3>
    <p>The game uses an infinite-sized rectangular grid of cells in which each cell is either
empty or occupied by an organism. The occupied cells are said to be alive, whereas
the empty ones are dead. The game is played over a specific period of time with each
turn creating a new generation based on the arrangement of live organisms in
the current conguration. The status of a cell in the next generation is determined
by applying the following four basic rules to each cell in the current conguration:</p>

<ol>
    <li>If a cell is alive and has either two or three live neighbors, the cell remains
alive in the next generation. The neighbors are the eight cells immediately
surrounding a cell: vertically, horizontally, and diagonally.    </li>
    <li>A living cell that has no live neighbors or a single live neighbor dies from
isolation in the next generation.    </li>
    <li>A living cell that has four or more live neighbors dies from overpopulation in
the next generation.    </li>
    <li>A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors results in a birth and becomes
alive in the next generation. All other dead cells remain dead in the next
generation.    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Life Grid ADT</h3>
<p>
A life grid is used to represent and store the area in the game of Life that contains
organisms. The grid contains a rectangular grouping of cells of a nite size divided
into rows and columns. The individual cells, which can be alive or dead, are
referenced by row and column indices, both of which start at zero.
</p>
<ul>
    <li> <i>LifeGrid </i>( nrows, ncols ): Creates a new game grid consisting of nrows and
ncols. All cells in the grid are set to dead. </li>
    <li> <i>numRows </i>(): Returns the number rows in the grid. </li>
    <li> <i>numCols </i>(): Returns the number of columns in the grid. </li>
    <li> <i>configure </i>( coordList ): Congures the grid for evolving the next genera-
tion. The coordList argument is a sequence of 2-tuples with each tuple
representing the coordinates (r; c) of the cells to be set as alive. All remaining
cells are cleared or set to dead. </li>
    <li> <i>clearCell </i>( row, col ): Clears the individual cell (row, col) and sets it to
dead. The cell indices must be within the valid range of the grid. </li>
    <li> <i>setCell </i>( row, col ): Sets the indicated cell (row, col) to be alive. The cell
indices must be within the valid range of the grid. </li>
    <li> <i>isLiveCell </i>( row,col ): Returns a boolean value indicating if the given cell
(row, col) contains a live organism. The cell indices must be within the valid
range of the grid. </li>
    <li> <i>numLiveNeighbors </i>( row, col ): Returns the number of live neighbors for the
given cell (row, col). The neighbors of a cell include all of the cells immediately
surrounding it in all directions. For the cells along the border of the grid, the
neighbors that fall outside the grid are assumed to be dead. The cell indices
must be within the valid range of the grid. </li>
</ul>
